#Day 3 Challenge focused on fixing code when the items are not intialized

#Code Fix #1
#Original Code

#Fixed Code

count_down(3)


#Code Fix #2
#Original Code
x = 1
sum = 0
while x < 10:
	sum = sum + x
	x = x + 1
product = 1
while x < 10:
    product = product * x
    x = x + 1
print(sum, product)
#Ouput 45 1-->incorrect because x for product has not been defined for the second block, so x=10 for the second block which is false

#Correct Code
x = 1
sum = 0
while x < 10:
	sum = sum + x
	x = x + 1
product = x
while x < 10:
    product = product * x
    x = x + 1
print(sum, product)

#In the IDLE

        sum = sum + x
        x = x + 1

            while x < 10:
