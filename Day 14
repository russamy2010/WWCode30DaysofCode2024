#Write a program that to print the first n numbers of a Fibonacci sequence

def fibonacci(n):
    a,b=0,1 #initialize the first two numbers in the sequence
    for i in range(n):
        print(a,end="") #Print the current number
        a,b=b,a+b #Update a and b for the next number

#Note: Fibonacci sequence is the series of numbers where each number 
        #is the sum of the two preceding numbers-->had to look it up
