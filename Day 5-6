#Solution to Additional practice from Day 4
# return whether the number is a power of the given base. 
def is_power_of(number, base):
 # Base case: when number is smaller than base.
    if number < base:
        # If number is equal to 1, it's a power (base**0).
        return base

    # Recursive case: keep dividing number by base.
    return is_power_of(number,base)

#Output
print(is_power_of(8,2))     # Should be True
print(is_power_of(64,4))    # Should be True
print(is_power_of(70,10))   # Should be False
